# TaskManager

Hello! This repo is a simple project that was made with the intent of practicing building a Rest API and HTTP requests using Node and Express along side with MongoDB.

<h2> The project </h2>
The name of the project says it all haha. You can create a task, edit, update, delete, mark as completed and so on. The project was not deployed due to autentication, wich i didnÂ´t make but in the Postman you can test it all out. The project was created in the Jhon Smilga course and the CSS was provided by him. If you have a sugestion about anything, please leave a coment, i would love to learn it more. See ya.
